I wasn't planning on making this change right now, but recent events have accelerated my schedule. I am retiring the **mjcb.io** domain and moving everything to the **mjcb.ca** domain for all of my online services. I wanted to make this change sooner rather than later, as it will take time for those changes to be propagated. Fortunately, I am not too concerned with a lot of the issues that arise from changing domains.

As of today, the **mjcb.io** domain that I have been using since 2018 is now deprecated. I am now using the **mjcb.ca** domain for my online presence. I have setup the old domain to redirect all URLs to the new domain, and it should be transparent to people that are using the old domain. This change also applies to the **docs.mjcb.io** domain as well, as it is being redirected to the **docs.mjcb.ca** domain. I will leave this redirect in place indefinitely.

There are a lot of reasons why I decided to make this change now, and I will go into details in a later post as there are a lot of other changes going on as well.

Other items will slowly be updated to reflect this new domain name, and will occur over the new few months.

Hopefully this change is completely transparent and doesn't cause any issues.
